# Readium 3.0.0
**The (the good parts) Medium-like theme for [Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost)**. Took the good parts of Medium (without really looking like Medium) to bring you a similar reading and blogging experience while giving you the freedom to host your content on your own servers and on your own terms.

![Readium 3.0](http://cl.ly/VBX3/readium2.jpg)

**Check out [Sven Reads Blog](http://www.svenread.com) as an example**.

Just drop this theme in your Ghost theme folder (and exptract it!) and choose it in your Ghost admin dashboard (after restarting Ghost).

If you give your images an alt text, it gets added automatically as figcaption beneath the image (sorry, no links or other HTML stuff). Awesomeness!

#### If your Ghost blog is self hosted:
1. Copy the contents of the .zip file into /content/themes/ and unzip it.
2. You need to restart your Ghost instance. After that you can switch themes inside your Ghost admin (http://your.domain.com/ghost/settings/general/). Scroll down and choose "Readium" from the theme dropdown.
3. Now you can customize your logo, langing page image (if you choose to have one), as well as user images and texts to fit the theme.
4. Have fun.

#### If your Ghost blog is hosted on the Ghost hosting platform:
1. Upload your Zip file via the Ghost admin panel.
2. Switch your theme to the Readium theme.
3. Have fun.
